              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>Although economically challenge, Ivan did his bests so that he college. When  he was in high school he studied very well and become the batch valedictorian. This is why it was easy for him to get a college scholarship. Aside from being a scholar he works as a student librarian at their university during his fee time so that he save for projects and other incidental express. If he works for 3 hours he will receive ₱150.00. if he works for 4 hours he will receive ₱200.00. How much is he earning for every hour that he works at the library?</p>
              <h3>EXPLORE</h3>
              <p>Ivan is indeed a model student. His perseverance and determination is worth emulating. Meanwhile, the problem given may be answered using ratio:</p>

              <p> Notice that the simplest form of the three given ratios is  Therefore, the ratio of the number of hours spent working in the library to the salary that Ivan receives is 1:50 which means that for every hour that Ivan works at the library, he gets 5O.OO.</p>
              <h3>EXPLAIN</h3>
              <p>Simplifying ratios is just the same as simplifying fractions since ratios can be written as fractions. To reduce ratios in simplest from, divide the numerator and the denominator of each ratio by their greatest common factor (GCF).The term “simplest form” is the same as “lowest terms” in ratios and fractions.</p>
