              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>Mark was asked by his mother to make 8 ounces of milk for his sister Sheila. He is always happy to help his mom. As he was making the milk, he has read from the can that for every 2 ounces of water, you have to put in 1 scoop of milk. His mother appreciated his help and said "Thank you son,I'm glad I can count on you." How many scoops of milk did Mark put in the feeding tabl?</p>
              <h3>EXPLORE</h3>
              <p>If you need 1 scoope of milk for every two ounces water, we need to find out how many schoops of milk is needed for 8 ounces of water.</p>
              <img src="../images/41.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" />
              <img src="../images/42.jpg" style="max-width: 100%" />
              <p>This problem is asking us to find equivalent ratios.<br><b><u>1 scoop</u> = ___<u>?</u>___<br>2 ounces&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 ounces</b></p>
              <p>In this example, the denominator at the left is less than the denominator at the right. This means that 4 is a miltiplier, so we have to multiply the remaining term by 4. Since the remaining term is 1, 1 x 4 = 4. The missing term is 4 such that 1/2 =4/8</p>
              <p>1/2 and 4/8 are equivalent ratios.<br>Therefore, Mark needs to put in 4 scoops of milk to 8 ounces of water to make a bottle of milk for his sister Sheila.</p>
              <h3>EXPLAIN</h3>
              <p>When two ratios are equivalent, they represent a <i>proportion.</i></p>
              <p>A proportion can be written in two ways, in fraction and colon forms.</p>
              <p>1/2 = 4/8 or 1:2 = 4:8</p>
              <p>Both are reas as 'one is to two as four is to eight'.</p>
              <br>
              <p><i>Example </i> Write the following as a proportion, in fraction and colon forms:</p>
              <p>1. two boxes contain 18 cookies, 10 boxes contain 60 cookies</p>
              <p>2. Mark earned P300.00 for 3 hours of work, while Jusitn earned P400.00 for 4 hours of work.</p>
              <p>3. John runs 3 miles every 5 days, 6 miles for 10 days</p>
              <p><i>Solution</i></p>
