              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>This morning your mother gave you ₱ 30.00 as your allowance. During recess time you went to the school canteens to buy your snack. The following are the price of the snacks:</p>

              <table border="1" width="100%">
                <tr>
                  <td>Sandwich</td>
                  <td>₱ 10.00</td>
                </tr>
                 
                <tr>
                  <td>Pancit</td>
                  <td>₱ 15.00</td>
                </tr>
                 
                <tr>
                 <td>Drinks</td>
                  <td>₱ 12.00</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              <p>Will your allowance be enough to buy all desired snacks?</p>
              <h3>EXPLORE</h3>
              <p>What numbers represent your allowance and expenses at the school canteens? Since your allowance is not enough to buy your desired snack, Knowing the total cost is ₱ 37.00, this means you still need ₱7.00 to  Buy your snacks.</p>
              <br>
              <p> In this case, your expenses are more than your allowance. This situation gives us the idea of negative numbers. Negative numbers have values less than 0. Positive numbers are the counting or natural numbers. Zero and positive number make up the set of whole numbers. Integers, your income is represented by a positive number while the expenses are represented by negative number.</p>
              <h3>EXPLAIN</h3>
              <p>Real-life situations can be represented by integers. For example, if a temperature reading is 25 degrees above zero, we say it is +25, and -25 degrees below zero. Another example is when you weight of 2kg, which can be represented by -3.</p>

              <p><i>Example</i><br>Write an integer to represent each situation:</p>

              <table border="1" width="100%">
                <tr>
                  <td>a.  Gain of 5 points</td>
                  <td>+5</td>
                </tr>
                 
                <tr>
                  <td>b.  8 steps backward </td>
                  <td>-8</td>
                </tr>
                 
                <tr>
                 <td>c.  A loss of 100 pesos</td>
                  <td>-100</td>
                </tr>
              </table>
                
                <p>The set of integers consists of the following:<br><b><i>
                         { . . .  , -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ,4 , 5, . . .}</i></b><br>One way to represent integers is through a number line.<br>Observe the number line below.</p>
             
           
                <br>
                <p>To the right of 0 are the positive integers, while to its left are the negative integers.Imagine folding the line at point 0, you will notice that 1 will fall at -1, 2 at -2, and 3 at -3. They are called the mirror images or opposites. Any integer has opposite. The opposite of +7 is -7. The opposite of +8 is -8. Two integers are opposites if they are of the same distance from 0.</p>
                <p>We can use the number line to compare and arrange integers.</p>
                <p>Integers can be positioned and ordered on a number line.As we move to the right on the number line, the numbers get larger in value. As we move to the left, the values get smaller. From the line above, we can see that a positive integer is greater than zero. Similarly, negative integers are less than zero. How do we compare both positive or both negative numbers? Study the following examples.</p>

                <h3>Math Challenge</h3>
                <p>1. Using the integers -1, 4, 40, and -25, create as many equations you can with an answer of 34. You can use each integer only once.<br>2.  Give 5 pairs of integers whose product is less than zero and whose sum is -26.<br>3.  Two negative consecutive integers have a sum of -21. What are they?<br>4.  Determine the pair of numbers whose product is 64 and whose sum 20.<br>5.  Give 10 pairs of integers whose product is greater than zero and whose sum is less than 50.</p>

                    <b>KEY IDEAS</b> 
<br>• The number line goes indefinitely in both directions. These are indicated by the arrows.<br>
• Integers greater than zero are called positive integers. These integers are found on the right side of zero on the number line.<br>
• Integers less than zero are called negative integers. These integers are on the left side of zero on the number line.<br>
• The integer zero is neutral. It is either positive nor negative.<br>
•  The sign of an integer is either positive (+) or negative (-), except zero, which has no sign.<br>
• Two integers are opposites if they are each of the same distance from zero. They are on opposite sides of the number line. One has a positive sign, the other a negative sign.    </blockquote>
