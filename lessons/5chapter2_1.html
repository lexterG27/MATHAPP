              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>In her birthday party, Cheska condacted a game called “The Boat” is sinking She asked her 24 guest kids to grouped themselves into 2,3,4,6 and 8. Each time she asked them to form groups no one is eliminated. But when she asked them group into 5 four kids were eliminated from the game. <br>Why is that so? If she will group the remaining kids them into three, how many of them will be eliminated?</p>
              <h3>EXPLORE</h3>
              <p>When 24 kids were asked to group themselves by 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 no  one was eliminated because 24 divisible by 2,3,4,6 and 8. But when 24 kids asked to group themselves into 5, for kids will eliminated. This is because 24 is not divisible by 5 then, there are 20 kids left. Twenty is not divisible by 3, so two kids will be eliminated. Then there remain 18 kids. If Cheska asks them to group themselves into 3 no one will be eliminated since 18 is divisible by three. </p>

However, 176 is not divisible by 3 since 1+ 7 + 6 =14 and 14 is not divisible by 3. Therefore 176 is not divisible by 6.</p>
