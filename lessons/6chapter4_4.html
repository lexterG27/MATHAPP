              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>Fritz is selling ethnic sandals from his father’s factory. One day, he decided to rent a stall in a market to sell his products. A customer can get a 10% discount for each ethnic sandals if he buys 3 pairs. Each costs ₱1,000.00 each exclusive of the 12% VAT (Value added Tax). For every pair of sandals that Fritz can sell, he gets 40% of the profit and the rest will be used for the payment of other expenses. If he gets the ethnic sandals from his father’s factory at ₱650.00 each, how much is Fritz’s total gain amount if he sells 120 ethnic sandals? How much will be remittedto BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue) for the 12% VAT?</p>

              <h3>EXPLAIN</h3>
              <h3>Discount, Sale Price, and Markup</h3>
              <p>Sometimes, you see an advertisement of a sale where the prices are reduced. The amount of reduction is called discount. If the discount is 50%, it means that the items are sold at “50% off” or at “half price.” To get the amount of discount use this formula:<br><b>Discount (D) = Discount Rate (DR) x Original Price (OP) or D =  DR x OP</b></p>
              <br>
              <p>The following terms are used in dealing with discount problems.<br><br>
              • Discount (D) is a decrease in the price of an item. It refers to the amount to be deducted from the original     price.<br>
              • Original Price (OP) is the regular price charged of the item.<br>
              • Discount Rate (DR) is the percent taken off from the original price<br>
              • Sale Price (SP) is also known as the net price or discounted price. It is the price of the item after the discount has been deducted.
              </p>

              <p>Discount and net price both represent percentage, original price represents the base, and the discount rate represents the rate.</p>
