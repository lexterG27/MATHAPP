              <h3>ENGAGE</h3>
              <p>Aubrey is excited today because it is their field trip to her favorite theme parl. Since one of her school’s objective for this activity is to develop friendship and camaraderie, her class, 5 justice, had to be combined  with another class, 6 Perseverance. Each class is composed of 40 pupils. The bus had 600 easts for pupils. The bus 60 seats for pupils and 4 seats for tour guides and teachers. However inside the bus Audrey notice that majority of the pupils on board were from 5-Perseverance and most of her classmates are not there yet. She counted that there is a total for 45 pupils inside the bus and only 15 of them were from her section (including herself).</p>
              <p>At that moment how does the number of pupils from 5 justice compare to the number of pupils from 5-Presverance? How does the number of pupils from 5-Justice compare with the total number of pupils on board? How does the number of pupils not on board compare to the pupils on board?</p>
              <p>The concept of ratio and proportion is used in different real-life scenarios . It is used in used in cooking, carpentry, science, money and fields. In this chapter we will learn to recog-nize the relationship between two quantities in symbols, and then apply them in real-life situations.  </p>
              <h3>EXPLORE</h3>
              <p>Field trips are really exciting because you are learning while having fun and most especially you well be spending it with your friends. The table below the given facts from the situation on the previous page.</p>
              <table border="1" width="100%">
                <tr>
                  <th>Section</th>
                  <th>On Board</th>
                  <th>Not On Board</th>
                  <th>Total</th>

                  <td>0</td>
                  <td>30</td>
                </tr>

                  <td>60</td>
                </tr>
                
              </table>
              <p>At the moment. How does the number of pupils from 5-Justice compare to the number of pupils from 5-Perseverance?<br><br>  There are 15 pupils from 15-Justice as compared to the 30 pupils from 5-Perseverance.<br><br> How does the number of pupils from 5-Justice on board compare with the total number for pupils on board? <br><br> From the table there are 15 pupils from 5-Justice on board as compared with the total number of 45 pupils on board. <br><br> How does the number of pupils not on board compare to the number of pupils on board?<br><br> The number of pupils not on board as compare to the number of pupils on board is 15 to 45.</p>
              <h3>EXPLAIN</h3>
              <p>A ratio is a comparison of two different thing or number. We generally express the two number as a ratio using a colon(:). <br><b>Example 1</b> from the situation given earlier:<br>If we want to compare:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The pupil on board for 5-Perseverance to the total number of the pupil on board we write 30:45 (Read: 30 is to 45).</li>
                <li>The total number of pupils not on board the total number of pupils on board then it is 15:45(Read: 30 it to 45).</li>
                <li>The total number of pupils on board to the total number of pupils from both section we write it as 40:60 (Read: 40 is to 60).</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Notice that the quantities in symbol are the same order as they are mention on the statement and that a colon is used to separate the two quantities. The colon is read “is to”</p>

              <p><b>Example 2</b>Anya was given twenty marbles of different colors:8 are pink , 7 are yellow and 5 are purple find the ratio of yellow marbles to purple marbles pink marbles to yellow marble and purple numbers to the number of marbles.</p>


              <table border="1" width="100%">
                <tr>
                  <th>Statement</th>
                  <th>Ratio</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Yellow marble to purple marble</td>
                  <td>7:5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Pink marble to yellow marble</td>
                  <td>8:7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Purple to the total number of marble</td>
                  <td>5:20</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              <p>Remember that yellow marble to purple marble (7:5) is different from the ratio of purple to yellow marble (5:7) ; Therefore it is important to consider the proper order given in the statement when writing ratios.<br>To verify this dividing 7 by 5 and 5 by 7. Did you get the same number? Certainly not. <br>A ratio is also defined as the quotient of the quantity divided by the second quantity. Therefor a ratio is also a fraction. The first quantity is placed in the numerator while the second quantity is place to denominator.<br>So to express the ratio of yellow marble to purple marble we can write It as  7/5.</p>

              <p>Franz is a caretaker in a large zoo. His morning routine includes the feeding the animals. He feed the 10 deer’s, 3 elephants  4 giraffes 3 zebras 9 monkey 6 snake 4 crocodiles and an alligator. Find the ratio of elephants to deer, giraffes to monkey snake to crocodiles monkey to deers and alligator to elephants. Write the ratios in both colon in fraction form.</p>
